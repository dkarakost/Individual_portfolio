## Original Personal Learning Plan 
My personal learning goals are: 
* Learning Goal 1
* Learning Goal 2
* Learning Goal 3


## Workflow 

- **Step 1:** Open the GoogleMapData.ipynb file use your Google Api Key in order to have the Beaches_v2-b file 
- **Step 2:** (Optional) open the file Data_Analysis_beforeMerge.ipynb to do a quick statistical analysis to WWF dataset
- **Step 3:** Open the DataPreperation.ipynb file. In the file load the manually corrected file beaches_corrected_final, which all the rows represent the corrected named and located beaches. Otherwise you can use the Beaches_vs-b but contains less beaches. 
- **Step 4:** Open the clean_coords.ipynb to correct the files data from merged dataset 
- **Step 5:** Open the DataAnalysis_afterMerge.ipynb to check the correlation of tourists and trash that has been found at each beach.
- **Step 6:** Open the interactive_heatmap.ipynb to create and download interactive heatmaps regarding the trash distribution.
- **Step 7:** Open Machine_Learning.ipynb to predict the beach amount for each beach for the next season.
