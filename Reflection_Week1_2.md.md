### Reflection Report, Week 1 and 2.



##### Week 1



###### What I did?





During first week my main task was to acquire the first dataset for our project but also to explore it in order to find out if it was a good match for our project goals. After searching for multiple datasets, I selected one that aligned with our project goals and contained spatial information related to beach locations. One of the project objectives was to analyze both overall and individual user ratings for beaches based on their names and locations. To achieve this, I connected the Google Places API to extract overall and individual user ratings for each beach that was included in the dataset. By reviewing the API and pandas documentation I then converted the results into a CSV file that matched the structure of the original dataset. Finally I opened a repository where I will host my personal portfolio.





###### How it meets my learning goals?



One of my learning goals was to efficiently search and interpret API documentation in order to configure requests and retrieve relevant data. This process was challenging and time-consuming, particularly when attempting to expand the API parameters to obtain richer and more relevant results. Despite these difficulties i successfully retrieved and processed the data which broaden my technical skills. All the above were developed in Jupyter Notebook environment.







##### Week 2





###### What I did?





During the second week, once both datasets were collected from different sources and included spatial information, I began exploring GeoDA to familiarize myself with its mapping and spatial analysis capabilities. I then conducted an abstract data analysis to examine the structure, size, and data types of the datasets. Following this after being able to understand data format I standardized datasets to the same format and including at least one common column to continue with data merging. I performed Statistical Analysis by making different plots and figures to examine the correlation of the Italy beaches and the their length, collected trash and trash seasonality. The visualizations included bar plots and line charts, which were created primarily using the Seaborn and Matplot library. Special attention was given to ensuring that the figures were clear and interpretable for a general audience.





###### How it meets my learning goals?



The creations of maps using GeoDA was very efficient and met the my goal in developing new spatial visualizations. Prior to visualization I managed to apply preprocess techniques such as cleaning, grouping and summarizing to ensure a good data structure, which leveraged my coding skills. To continue, after obtaining a organized data structure, plots and line charts were created by using Seaborn giving the opportunity of learning a new library. Reading the Seaborn documentation and making plots was time consuming and challenging and, in order to save some time I made some figures by using a more familiar library such as matplotlib. All above were developed in Jupyter notebooks environment.
